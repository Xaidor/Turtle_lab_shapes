# Turtle Graphics Drawing Program 🐢🎨

## Overview
This project is an interactive Python program built using the Turtle graphics library.  
Users can select from multiple shapes, customize colors, and choose whether shapes are filled or outlined.  
The project was designed to practice core software engineering concepts such as decomposition, functions, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

## Features
- User-selected shapes (basic and complex)
- Custom color selection
- Filled or outlined drawing options
- Input validation to ensure correct user choices
- Modular design using reusable functions

## Shapes Included
- Square
- Star
- Cloud with a sun peeking through (complex shape)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Turtle Graphics
- Control Flow (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modular design

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your machine
2. Clone this repository
3. Run the program:
